Bot GUI
-use for music and other things

info stuff
help command
ping
user info
server info

--cross server tags
--get
--set
--delete
--global
--per server
saving attachments
save attachment to bot if under a certain size limit
possibly save to somewhere like google drive and recall the file for sending
could also just copy the link to the attachment and send that with the message although
that is at risk of becoming useless if the original message is deleted or modified

add use_count to the tag data, for fun
add ways to modify tags, change name, edit contents, update contents



music functionality
--joining/leaving
--queue, active sessions
--play/pause
--youtube,spotify
--files
--looping
--skipping
--playlist creation and saving
--queue to playlist
--seeking
--stop command
priority queue "play next"
plays the song first in the queue


SCROLLABLE TEXT / MESSAGES
keep track of view instances per server as a variable and track the current index
only delete the view if it falls out of index
maybe keep a list of limited size and pop + append new views
set del to clear the view from the message or just do it manually
figure out what the hell is wrong with the player and currently playing

- custom soundboards per server
--play sound
--stop sound
--add sound
--delete sound
--list all sounds



auto reactions
store under the key
'sentinel_phrases': {
    'sentinal': {
        'use_count': 0,
        'reaction': '',
        'response': ''
    }
}

reorganize global data under a seperate key
'global': {
    'tags': {}
    'sentinels': {}
}

try to use a tranformer for autocomplete instead of a regular autocomplete
this lets me pass arguments for the initialization of a transformer so the autocmplete will work with both global and local without any weird namespace fuckery



reaction event handling
adding reactions with bot




per server settings and data
word tallying
nice embeds

--command group/cog reloading

write a decorator for checking if a parameter is actually valid
possible list of parameters with their associate auto completes
and or list of possible solutions

fetch server from the id, ie create a new server object or get an existing one
